# The Operating System Image Repo
This is a personal repository with the purpose of tracking my arch operating sytem image which will be used to install and update my system at home (and maybe on the go?)

## Assumptions
We have the following assumptions for our work:
- We are working in a traditional x64 system environment
- the image will ultimately be put to disk, complete with a partition table
- updates will be done with sys-update in an A/B fashion as we have done much of the prep work to make the two drive possible
- we are running arch linux
- we will be using btrfs as our root filesystem
